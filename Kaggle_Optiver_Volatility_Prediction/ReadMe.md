This is the jupyter notebook we did for the Optiver Volatility Prediction competition on September 2021.

Our unofficial ranking is 222/3965, and we got a bronze medal now. This ranking is not final, becuase a 3 months' real market back testing is required, so the final result will be revealed on 2022 January.
