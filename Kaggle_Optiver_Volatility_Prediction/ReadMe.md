This is the jupyter notebook we did for the Optiver Volatility Prediction competition on September 2021.

Our unofficial ranking is 222/3965, and it's bronze medal currently. This ranking is not final, becuase a 3 months' real market forecasting is required, and the final result will be revealed in 2022 January.
