This file contains a report and a notebook. This is the homework for the course Foundation of Deep Learning.

We didn't have a very good ranking in this Kaggle Competition :(

The codes here in the notebook is rather "novice".

I will try my best to learn more things, to make my understanding in DL and ML better and better!
