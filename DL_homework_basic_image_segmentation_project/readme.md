This file contains a report and a notebook. This is the homework for the course Foundation of Deep Learning.

We didn't have a very good ranking in this Kaggle Competition :(

The link to the in-class competition is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fdl21-fdl-dsba/submissions?sortBy=publicScore&page=1&pageSize=100

The codes here in the notebook is rather "novice".

I will try my best to learn more things, to make my understanding in DL and ML better and better!
