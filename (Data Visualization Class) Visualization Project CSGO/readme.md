Data Visualization Project on CSGO player performance analysis.

Used streamlit and atlair to build website and interactive graphs.

This little project was already deployed here: https://share.streamlit.io/brieglhostis/datavisualizationcsgo/main/dashboard.py

Course professor website: https://tobias.isenberg.cc/visualization/Assignments/Assignment4

How to use it locally:

- Download the file
- CD this directory
- pip install streamlit
- Input: streamlit run dashboard.py
- Then you will see a local website is opened. Do whatever you want.

By the way, streamlit was created for machine learning interactions, if I have time I will do another project and use this tool to visualize everything, like trees, nodes, clustering etc.

No copyright, do whatever you want.
